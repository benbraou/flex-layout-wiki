(future features)

Different from responsive layouts where components change sizes and positions, the concepts of Adaptive layouts 
provide for UX where  **different components** may be used for different breakpoints. 

Animations can also be extended to support MediaQuery activations: different animations will run for different viewport sizes.

Developers can use the following:

*  `fx-hide`
*  `fx-show`
*  `ngIf`

> This will be documented more before release 1.
